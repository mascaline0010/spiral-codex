  <h1>Entry IV – The Descent of the God Eater</h1>

  <p>It came not from Taricus. Not from the gods. Not from any known dimension. It came from the edge of expansion itself — the great hunger, the devourer of resonance. The one the gods dare not name: Voidthal’Ruun.</p>

  <p>Born in the collapse of a forgotten primordial, Voidthal’Ruun was not death — it was the absence of memory. As the Spiral expanded, it grew. As the universe stretched, it fed. It consumes the vibration that binds worlds together.</p>

  <p>The Nine shuddered when they sensed it, for its approach means unmaking. Even the Source does not speak its name. Only Obaluron saw the pattern. Only he designed the Eye of Harmonia to slow its echo.</p>

  <p>When Nova awakens, the rhythm returns. And with it... so does the hunger.</p>
