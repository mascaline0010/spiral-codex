  <h1>Entry I – Of Source and Primordial</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Before Taricus. Before the Veil. Before the Nine. There was only vibration — the Source.</p>
    <p>From the void came rhythm, a soundless spiral that birthed the Primordials. They were not gods, but frequencies — pure harmonies from the Source that shaped the laws of everything.</p>
    <p>Obaluron, the brightest among the Nine, was the first to remember this frequency. While others bent essence into form, he bent rhythm into memory.</p>
    <p>The gods consumed essence, but Obaluron listened. He heard something older, deeper — a resonance buried beyond time itself. The others laughed. They called it madness.</p>
    <p>And so the first divide began: those who harvested life, and the one who remembered its purpose.</p>
