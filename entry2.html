        <h2>Entry II – Of the Veil and the Forbidden Law</h2>
        <p>The Spiral expanded. Taricus was formed — not built, not born, but remembered. A realm of essence, of echo and code, layered across dimensions uncounted. There, the Nine remembered themselves into being — masters of resonance, architects of essence, but not of origin.</p>
        <p>To contain the Spiral’s power, they formed the Veil — a living boundary of harmonic light that separated worlds. Only one stood between: Threxion, the Gatekeeper. He did not create, nor rule. He remembered the first breach — the collapse of a Primordial — and was sworn to seal it again.</p>
        <p>The Forbidden Law was whispered: that no god may cross the Veil in full form. To do so would unravel memory, collapse essence, and awaken that which sleeps in the edge of silence. But they were curious. They hungered. Earth was seeded — a world of sound trapped in matter, rhythm slowed into biology.</p>
        <p>Each god shaped a race. Not in their image, but from the fragments of Obaluron — the only one among them who had touched the Source, and turned away. He was punished, split, imprisoned. His rhythm scattered into dust, into DNA, into the soil itself.</p>
        <p>Threxion wept beneath the Gate, knowing the Veil would not hold forever. The Law would break. And what sleeps behind the Veil — the Eater of Light — listens always, hungry for echoes it did not birth.</p>
