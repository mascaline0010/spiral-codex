    <h2>Entry II – Of the Veil and the Forbidden Law</h2>
    <p>The Spiral expanded. Taricus was formed — not built, not born, but remembered. Light wove its way into meaning, and form took memory as its shape.</p>
    <p>Between all things, a barrier was placed — the Veil. None of the Nine were permitted to cross it, save one: Threxion, the Keeper of Silence, who swore never to speak again.</p>
    <p>It was said, should a god ever pierce the Veil, the harmony would be broken, and the Spiral would scream...</p>
