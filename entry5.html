    <h1>Entry V – The Memory War</h1>
    <h2>The Shattered Echoes</h2>
    <p>The gods feared the return of memory more than the God Eater itself. For if man remembered, the illusion would end. The Veil would crack. Taricus would bleed.</p>
    <p>Nova did not only carry the Source’s rhythm—she bore fragments of Obaluron’s divine memory. Each memory was a weapon. Each echo, a truth.</p>
    <p>Selarion summoned the Lumyrae legions to silence her. Zynostra turned the sky into a memory snare. But it was too late. The war had begun—not with swords, but with remembrance.</p>
    <p>As Nova activated the hidden tones, cities collapsed, gods faltered, and lost tribes awakened. Across Earth and Taricus, echoes stirred in ancient pyramids, drums, and dust.</p>
    <p>The Memory War was not fought in time—but in truth. And truth, once remembered, cannot be undone.</p>
