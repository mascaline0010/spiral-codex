        <h2>Entry III – The Memory War</h2>
        <p>
            Memory was not a tool. It was a weapon.<br>
            The gods who ruled Taricus were not satisfied with form and essence.<br>
            They began to shape memory itself—to rewrite what beings believed to be true.
        </p>
        <p>
            In silence, they walked among their creations, planting dreams and doubts.<br>
            They turned memory into doctrine, into history, into chains.<br>
            And in doing so, they blinded generations to the Source.
        </p>
        <p>
            But one—the god Obaluron—remembered the First Sound.<br>
            And through him, a fragment of truth survived.<br>
            That memory would awaken one day… as rebellion.
