        <h2>Entry III – Of Echo and Divine Memory</h2>
        <p>
            Every echo from the Source was a ripple of memory. Where mortals heard sound, the gods heard instruction. 
            Before Taricus fully awakened, the Spiral encoded these echoes into living memory, scattered across the folds of light.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Nine heard the memory differently. Selarion saw light-shapes that moved in symmetry. Zynostra felt time in vibration. 
            Threxion, who guarded the Veil, saw only silence and wondered why. But Obaluron… Obaluron heard a name.
        </p>
        <p>
            That name would become the code he used to form man — not of obedience, but of rhythm. It was not forbidden knowledge. 
            It was forgotten knowledge, waiting to be remembered again in human form.
