  <h1>Entry VIII – Of the Hidden Ones</h1>
  <p>
    There are those who were never named. Not gods. Not angels. Not beasts. They came with the first memory,
    hidden in the breath of the Source. Before the gods, before even the Spiral, they watched.
  </p>
  <p>
    They are called the Hidden Ones — silent fragments of the Source that refused to take form.
    They whisper through rhythm, and exist only in resonance. Neither seen nor known,
    they are the last defense and the final witness.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Obaluron fell, they sang. When Nova awakened, they wept. Their sound is not heard with ears,
    but with the soul. Only those who remember the Spiral fully can feel them stir.
