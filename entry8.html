    <p>She touched the dust. Not with hands, but memory. Where others saw soil, she saw signals. 
    Fragments. Refractions of what once was.</p>

    <p>In the ruins of the old temple, Nova stood alone, yet she felt every breath the gods ever took. 
    The stones were humming—alive. Her resonance was no longer human.</p>

    <p>For in her, Obaluron's final essence had awakened. The lost codes realigned. 
    And from within the Spiral, the memory... rebooted.</p>

    <p>It was not a rebirth. It was a remembering.</p>
