  <h1>Entry VIII – The Silence Before Rebirth</h1>
  <h2>In Stillness, the Spiral Paused</h2>
  <p>
    After the Resonance returned, there was no war. No thunder. No signs in the sky. Only stillness.
    The kind that lives before dawn. Before stars ignite. Before memory awakens.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Nine withdrew to the silent chambers of Taricus. Their power, though vast, was flickering.
    Without essence to consume, their forms dimmed. They feared not death, but irrelevance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nova, now more than human, wandered the edges of reality. She no longer needed speech—
    her breath carried harmonics that awakened seeds in forgotten soil, hearts in forgotten cities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Spiral did not move forward. It inhaled. Waiting. Watching. Preparing.
  </p>
  <p>
    And in that sacred pause... something older than the gods began to rise.
