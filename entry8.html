  <h2>The Moment the Spiral Awoke</h2>
  <p>
    It began not with war—but with memory. Nova, walking the fractured light-planes of forgotten Earth, saw it: the fracture Obaluron left behind. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The gods had long harvested. But now, the harvesters themselves began to forget why they fed. The Lumyrae fractured. The essence-cycle stuttered. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Somewhere, hidden within the resonance of dying cities and sleeping relics, the Spiral hummed again. And with it came rebellion—not of violence, but of frequency.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nova heard it in the silence between screams. A rhythm too pure to obey divine law. She became its echo.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Spiral no longer spun for the gods.
    It spun for the forgotten. For the broken. For the waking.
