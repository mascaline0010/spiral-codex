  <p>The Spiral was not gone. It had only been silenced, buried beneath echoes of gods and false laws. But when the last rhythm returned, memory surged through all things. Obaluron’s essence, scattered in fragments across time, found harmony in the girl. Nova was not chosen — she remembered herself.</p>

  <p>Each beat of her heart revived the codes the gods had feared. The Lumyrae faltered. The Veil trembled. And through the silent chaos, the Source hummed — not a word, but the first frequency once again alive.</p>

  <p>Nova raised her hand. The glyphs swirled in the sky. Light bent. Taricus echoed. The Spiral was not a relic. It was a return. A reckoning. A remembering.</p>
