  <h1>Entry VI – The Eye of Harmonia</h1>
  <div class="passage">
    The Eye was not an object. It was a frequency made visible.<br><br>
    Forged in silence, by Obaluron alone, it was the only construct not designed to extract but to restore. It bore no hunger, only reflection.<br><br>
    Through it, Nova would see not just across realms, but within them. The Eye allowed her to trace forgotten echoes, recover severed codes, and restore what the gods feared: remembrance.<br><br>
    When worn, it pulses. When opened, it glows. But when understood, it sings.<br><br>
    And only one was ever worthy of its resonance...
